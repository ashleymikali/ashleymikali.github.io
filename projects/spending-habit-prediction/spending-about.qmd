# Introduction

This project investigates how self-control and materialistic tendencies influence spending behaviors in young adults (18-24). Using data from the National Financial Well-Being Survey (collected by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau), I explored how these factors impact the likelihood of exhibiting “good” or “bad” spending habits across different age groups.

# Data Source

The data was collected from a diverse sample of adults (18 and older) across all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia, conducted between October 27 and December 5, 2016. The sample included 6,394 individuals (5,295 from the general population and 999 from an oversample of adults aged 62 and over). This dataset is randomized and aims to be representative of the adult population.

# Research Question

How do self-control and materialistic tendencies influence spending behaviors in young adults (18-24)?

# Environment

This project was done using **RStudio** (version 4.4.2).

## Packages Used

`RColorBrewer`, `broom`, `mosaic`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `ggformula`, `knitr`, and other libraries were used for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis.

# Methodology

I performed a series of logistic regressions to assess the relationship between materialism, self-control, and spending habits. The following steps were taken:

1.  **Data Wrangling**: The raw data was cleaned and transformed into usable categories (e.g., spending habits were classified as binary).
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualization and summaries were created to better understand the patterns.
3.  **Logistic Regression Models**: Four logistic regression models were compared based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and statistical significance of predictors.

# Models and Results

## Model Comparison

-   **Model 1**: Simple logistic regression using materialism as a predictor.

-   **Model 2**: Logistic regression with materialism and impulsivity as predictors.

-   **Model 3**: Logistic regression with self-control and materialism as predictors.

-   **Model 4**: A more complex logistic regression model that includes an interaction between self-control and materialism.

## Model Selection

-   **Best Model Based on AIC**: Model 3

-   **Best Model Based on BIC**: Model 2

-   **Best Model Based on Significance**: Model 2 (all p-values were statistically significant).

After careful consideration, Model 3 was selected as the primary model. This decision was based on its stronger analytical credibility (as indicated by the AIC) and its alignment with the research question, as it accounts for both predictor variables. While Model 2 also performed well, it only considered one of the predictors, making it less representative of the full scope of the research.

# Final Thoughts

The analysis indicates that both self-control and materialism have an impact on spending habits, with impulsivity showing a stronger influence than materialism. While the results offer insight into young adults’ behaviors, generalizability is limited due to the self-reported nature of the variables and the inherent ambiguities in measuring spending habits.
