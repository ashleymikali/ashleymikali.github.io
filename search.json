(I’ll edit this in the future after I manage to find receipts from… so many years ago.)\nSo, excluding HTML, Swift, and SQL, my experience went something like this:\n\nPascal, then\nC, then\nPython\n\nOne of these is so very obviously not like the others, right? Right????? Everyone, point your finger at the one language that isn’t as explicit and structured as the others.\nI used Pascal and C in high school. I didn’t touch Python until I did the MOOC I mentioned earlier, and didn’t really get into it until I started college.\nAnd man, did I struggle with Python when I just started. I had the programming fundamentals locked down to some extent (at least for the Introduction to Computer Science class), but going from something as explicit as C to something like Python was a bit challenging.\nMy teacher said that I was making my code needlessly complex and that I was using “C brain”.",

    "text": "How It All Comes Together\nI’ve adapted somewhat to Python now, but I think the reason I find R to be easier is because of my “C brain”, that is, because I got my start using more structured and explicit languages, and R gives me that kind of space.\nHear me out: Yes, R is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted language. Not too different from Python, I guess. But R encourages more structure and explicitness than Python does; the latter is designed to be more intuitive by using natural language and a lot of magic behind the scenes.\nI feel more confident using tidymodels than scikit-learn. Boil that down to familiarity in structure, I suppose.",

    "text": "Enter the Crab Cult\nNow, you might be wondering, “How on Earth is the title relevant?” And that, dear future me reader, is a valid question.\nFor the last few months, I’ve been fascinated by Rust. And I, unsurprisingly, now want to rewrite everything in Rust. I’ll let the following image explain this for me:\n\n\n\n\n\nBUT WHY?????????\nBecause Rust has more in common with C than Python (in my uneducated opinion, which could very well be wrong). AND IT LOOKS FUN!!!!\nThis:\n{Rust}\nstruct AboutMe {\n    pronouns: String,\n    majors: Vec&lt;String&gt;,\n    specialization: String,\n    languages: Vec&lt;String&gt;,\n    hobbies: Vec&lt;String&gt;,\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let ash = AboutMe {\n        pronouns: String::from(\"She/her\"),\n        majors: vec![\n            String::from(\"Computer Science-Mathematics\"),\n            String::from(\"Philosophy\")\n        ],\n        specialization: String::from(\"Data Science\"),\n        languages: vec![\n            String::from(\"Python\"),\n            String::from(\"Rust\"),\n            String::from(\"SQL\"),\n            String::from(\"R\"),\n            String::from(\"C\"),\n        ],\n        hobbies: vec![\n            String::from(\"Music Curation\"),\n            String::from(\"Video Games\"),\n            String::from(\"Reading\"),\n        ],\n    };\n}\nis longer, sure, but so much more explicit than this:\n{Python}\nclass AboutMe:\n  def __init__(self):\n    self.name = \"ash\"\n    self.pronouns = \"She/her\"\n    self.majors = [\"Computer Science-Mathematics\", \"Philosophy\"]\n    self.specialization = \"Data Science\"\n    self.languages = [\"Python\", \"Rust\", \"SQL\", \"R\", \"C\"]\n    self.hobbies = [\"Music Curation\", \"Video Games\", \"Reading\"]\nWill you catch me trying to use Rust or R with SQL any time soon? Of course not, I’m trying to decompress this summer, not give myself extra stress (which means I will likely do this at 3 am on a random Tuesday morning when I feel unhinged). I can admit that the Python + SQL combo is pretty good, though, in my experience.\nAlas, if you’re still wondering how crabs or cults relate to any of this, it’s because:\n\nSome say that Rust has a cult following;\nRust’s mascot is a crab (which I think is better than Python’s mascot, so can I give it bonus points for that?).\n\nAnyways, let’s close this ramble with a classic: the crab rave! Good times. I felt so giddy and nostalgic watching this for the first time in years 😭.\n\n\nAlright, I’m signing off for real now. I have wise crabs to consult.\n\n\n\n\n\n· · ─ ·𖥸· ─ · ·",

    "text": "6.2 Models, Metrics, & Thoughts\nFirst, I fitted a binary logistic regression model and included all of the predictor variables. This served as a baseline for feature selection.\n\n\nFitting General Model With All Predictors (expand to view code)\ngeneral_model &lt;- glm(spending_binary ~ . - spending_habit, data = finance_modeling, family = \"binomial\")\n\n\n\n6.2.1 Feature Selection\nI used stepwise selection (both forward and backward) to identify the “best” set of predictors (i.e., predictors with a statistically meaningful relationship to the response variable). This was done twice: once using AIC (Akaike Information Criterion), and once using BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion).\nAIC and BIC are model selection metrics, but they have different priorities. AIC prioritizes predictive performance by balancing model fit and model complexity, while BIC prioritizes simpler models by applying a stronger penalty for model complexity.\nIn other words, AIC generally favors more complex models that include predictors contributing meaningfully to accuracy, whereas BIC is stricter and prefers a simpler model with only the most impactful predictors.\nApplied here, AIC is used to identify predictors that have some relationship with the response, while BIC narrows our focus to the strongest predictors.\n\n\nStepwise Selection with AIC (expand to view code)\nmodel_AIC &lt;- stepAIC(general_model, direction = \"both\", k = 2, trace = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\nStepwise Selection with BIC (expand to view code)\n# I needed to get the number of observations\nn &lt;- nrow(finance_modeling)\n\nmodel_BIC &lt;- stepAIC(general_model, direction = \"both\", k = log(n), trace = FALSE)\n\n\n\n6.2.1.1 Examining the AIC Model\nAccording to the AIC model, the most indicative predictors of spending habits include:\n\nFinancial behaviors: ability to follow [financial] commitments, be frugal, resist temptation, and work toward long-term goals; financial well-being score\nCognitive preferences: preference for numbers over words and comfort with percentages\nPsychological factors: confidence in financial goals, desire to impress others, psychological connectedness, stress, and impulsivity\nDemographics: age group\n\n\n\nAIC Model Formula (expand to view code)\nformula(model_AIC)\n\n\nspending_binary ~ follow_commitment + frugality + worded_probability + \n    percentage_skill + goal_confidence + impress_people + psych + \n    distress + impulsivity + resist_temptation + long_term_goals + \n    age_group + wellbeing\n\n\n\n\n6.2.1.2 Examining the BIC Model\nAccording to the BIC model, the strongest predictors related to one’s spending habits are\n\nAbility to follow commitments\nFrugality\nConfidence in achieving financial goals\nImpulsivity\nAbility to resist temptation\nFinancial well-being score\n\n\n\nBIC Model Formula (expand to view code)\nformula(model_BIC)\n\n\nspending_binary ~ follow_commitment + frugality + goal_confidence + \n    impulsivity + resist_temptation + wellbeing\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.2 Model Assumptions\nSuccessful logistic regression requires a few assumptions, namely:\n\nLinearity of Log-Odds\nI assessed this by plotting the log-odds against the predictors. This required a few steps:\n\n\nMaking a New Data Frame With Predictors and Response From Model (expand to view code)\nbic_finance &lt;- finance_modeling |&gt;\n  dplyr::select(spending_binary, follow_commitment, frugality, goal_confidence, impulsivity, resist_temptation, wellbeing)\n\n\n\n\nExtracting Predicted Probabilities (expand to view code)\npredictors &lt;- colnames(bic_finance) \n\nbic_finance$probabilities &lt;- model_BIC$fitted.values\n\n\n\n\nCalculating Logit Values (expand to view code)\nbic_finance &lt;- bic_finance |&gt;\n  mutate(logit = log(probabilities/(1-probabilities))) |&gt;\n  dplyr::select(-probabilities) |&gt;\n  gather(key = \"predictors\", value = \"predictor.value\", -logit) \n\n\n\n\nDisplaying Log-Odds Against Predictors (expand to view code)\nlog_plot &lt;- ggplot(bic_finance, aes(y = logit, x = predictor.value))+\n  geom_point(size = 0.5, alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\") + \n  theme_bw() + \n  facet_wrap(~predictors, scales = \"free_x\")\n\nlog_plot\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe categorical (ordinal) predictors appeared stable across levels. The continuous variable wellbeing showed a roughly linear trend, suggesting the assumption of linearity on the logit scale was reasonably met.\nTo avoid redundancy, I only did this for the BIC model. We can reasonably assume that the assumption holds true for the AIC model.\nIndependence of Observations\nEach observation represents a unique, individual survey response. No groups (such as same households or repeat responses) are present. Therefore, the model meets this assumption.\nAbsence of Multicollinearity\nI used vif() to look for potential multicollinearity.\nAIC Model:\n\n\nAIC Model Variance (expand to view code)\nvif_aic &lt;- vif(model_AIC)\nvif_aic |&gt; kable()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGVIF\nDf\nGVIF^(1/(2*Df))\n\n\n\n\nfollow_commitment\n1.325389\n4\n1.035841\n\n\nfrugality\n1.273549\n5\n1.024475\n\n\nworded_probability\n1.293823\n5\n1.026095\n\n\npercentage_skill\n1.396970\n5\n1.033996\n\n\ngoal_confidence\n1.664631\n3\n1.088645\n\n\nimpress_people\n1.299022\n4\n1.033242\n\n\npsych\n1.160909\n1\n1.077455\n\n\ndistress\n1.423641\n4\n1.045141\n\n\nimpulsivity\n1.294653\n3\n1.043980\n\n\nresist_temptation\n1.455748\n3\n1.064587\n\n\nlong_term_goals\n1.651653\n3\n1.087226\n\n\nage_group\n1.388850\n7\n1.023740\n\n\nwellbeing\n1.676884\n1\n1.294945\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \\(GVIF^{(\\frac{1}{2\\times Df})}\\) column contains adjusted VIF values.
