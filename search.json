    "text": "Hi, I’m Ash. I’m a junior double majoring in Philosophy and Mathematics-Computer Science with a specialization in Data Science. I’m especially interested in the philosophy of mind and the ways data science and philosophy intersect, particularly when it comes to understanding human behavior and decision-making. Data science lets me explore real-world problems, while my background in philosophy helps me think critically about the implications of what I find.\nWhen I’m not working on school stuff, you can find me playing indie games like Stardew Valley or Moonstone Island. I’m a fan of all sorts of music, from jazz to hyperpop to rock. I also love cozy things; hot chocolate, blankets, and autumn are some of my favorite comforts. If I’m not playing video games or listening to music, I’ll probably be baking cupcakes (they’re easier to share) for my friends or catching up on Severance (no spoilers, please).\n\nYou can find my GitHub here.\n\n\n Back to top",

This served as a baseline for feature selection.\n\n\nFitting General Model With All Predictors (expand to view code)\ngeneral_model &lt;- glm(spending_binary ~ . - spending_habit, data = finance_modeling, family = \"binomial\")\n\n\n\n6.2.1 Feature Selection\nI used stepwise selection (both forward and backward) to identify the “best” set of predictors (i.e., predictors with a statistically meaningful relationship to the response variable). This was done twice: once using AIC (Akaike Information Criterion), and once using BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion).\nAIC and BIC are model selection metrics, but they have different priorities. AIC prioritizes predictive performance by balancing model fit and model complexity, while BIC prioritizes simpler models by applying a stronger penalty for model complexity.\nIn other words, AIC generally favors more complex models that include predictors contributing meaningfully to accuracy, whereas BIC is stricter and prefers a simpler model with only the most impactful predictors.\nApplied here, AIC is used to identify predictors that have some relationship with the response, while BIC narrows our focus to the strongest predictors.\n\n\nStepwise Selection with AIC (expand to view code)\nmodel_AIC &lt;- stepAIC(general_model, direction = \"both\", k = 2, trace = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\nStepwise Selection with BIC (expand to view code)\n# I needed to get the number of observations\nn &lt;- nrow(finance_modeling)\n\nmodel_BIC &lt;- stepAIC(general_model, direction = \"both\", k = log(n), trace = FALSE)\n\n\n\n6.2.1.1 Examining the AIC Model\nAccording to the AIC model, the most indicative predictors of spending habits include:\n\nFinancial behaviors: ability to follow [financial] commitments, be frugal, resist temptation, and work toward long-term goals; financial well-being score\nCognitive preferences: preference for numbers over words and comfort with percentages\nPsychological factors: confidence in financial goals, desire to impress others, psychological connectedness, stress, and impulsivity\nDemographics: age group\n\n\n\nAIC Model Formula (expand to view code)\nformula(model_AIC)\n\n\nspending_binary ~ follow_commitment + frugality + worded_probability + \n    percentage_skill + goal_confidence + impress_people + psych + \n    distress + impulsivity + resist_temptation + long_term_goals + \n    age_group + wellbeing\n\n\n\n\n6.2.1.2 Examining the BIC Model\nAccording to the BIC model, the strongest predictors related to one’s spending habits are\n\nAbility to follow commitments\nFrugality\nConfidence in achieving financial goals\nImpulsivity\nAbility to resist temptation\nFinancial well-being score\n\n\n\nBIC Model Formula (expand to view code)\nformula(model_BIC)\n\n\nspending_binary ~ follow_commitment + frugality + goal_confidence + \n    impulsivity + resist_temptation + wellbeing\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.2 Model Assumptions\nSuccessful logistic regression requires a few assumptions, namely:\n\nLinearity of Log-Odds\nI assessed this by plotting the log-odds against the predictors. This required a few steps:\n\n\nMaking a New Data Frame With Predictors and Response From Model (expand to view code)\nbic_finance &lt;- finance_modeling |&gt;\n  dplyr::select(spending_binary, follow_commitment, frugality, goal_confidence, impulsivity, resist_temptation, wellbeing)\n\n\n\n\nExtracting Predicted Probabilities (expand to view code)\npredictors &lt;- colnames(bic_finance) \n\nbic_finance$probabilities &lt;- model_BIC$fitted.values\n\n\n\n\nCalculating Logit Values (expand to view code)\nbic_finance &lt;- bic_finance |&gt;\n  mutate(logit = log(probabilities/(1-probabilities))) |&gt;\n  dplyr::select(-probabilities) |&gt;\n  gather(key = \"predictors\", value = \"predictor.value\", -logit) \n\n\n\n\nDisplaying Log-Odds Against Predictors (expand to view code)\nlog_plot &lt;- ggplot(bic_finance, aes(y = logit, x = predictor.value))+\n  geom_point(size = 0.5, alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\") + \n  theme_bw() + \n  facet_wrap(~predictors, scales = \"free_x\")\n\nlog_plot\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe categorical (ordinal) predictors appeared stable across levels. The continuous variable wellbeing showed a roughly linear trend, suggesting the assumption of linearity on the logit scale was reasonably met.\nTo avoid redundancy, I only did this for the BIC model. We can reasonably assume that the assumption holds true for the AIC model.\nIndependence of Observations\nEach observation represents a unique, individual survey response. No groups (such as same households or repeat responses) are present. Therefore, the model meets this assumption.\nAbsence of Multicollinearity\nI used vif() to look for potential multicollinearity.\nAIC Model:\n\n\nAIC Model Variance (expand to view code)\nvif_aic &lt;- vif(model_AIC)\nvif_aic |&gt; kable()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGVIF\nDf\nGVIF^(1/(2*Df))\n\n\n\n\nfollow_commitment\n1.325389\n4\n1.035841\n\n\nfrugality\n1.273549\n5\n1.024475\n\n\nworded_probability\n1.293823\n5\n1.026095\n\n\npercentage_skill\n1.396970\n5\n1.033996\n\n\ngoal_confidence\n1.664631\n3\n1.088645\n\n\nimpress_people\n1.299022\n4\n1.033242\n\n\npsych\n1.160909\n1\n1.077455\n\n\ndistress\n1.423641\n4\n1.045141\n\n\nimpulsivity\n1.294653\n3\n1.043980\n\n\nresist_temptation\n1.455748\n3\n1.064587\n\n\nlong_term_goals\n1.651653\n3\n1.087226\n\n\nage_group\n1.388850\n7\n1.023740\n\n\nwellbeing\n1.676884\n1\n1.294945\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \\(GVIF^{(\\frac{1}{2\\times Df})}\\) column contains adjusted VIF values.

No observations exceeded the common threshold of ±3, suggesting the model fits individual data points well and meets the assumption of no extreme residuals.\n\n\nAugmenting Model and Filtering Residuals (expand to view code)\nmodel_info &lt;- augment(model_BIC)\n\nmodel_info |&gt;\n  filter(abs(.std.resid) &gt; 3)\n\n\n# A tibble: 0 × 13\n# ℹ 13 variables: spending_binary &lt;dbl&gt;, follow_commitment &lt;fct&gt;,\n#   frugality &lt;fct&gt;, goal_confidence &lt;fct&gt;, impulsivity &lt;fct&gt;,\n#   resist_temptation &lt;fct&gt;, wellbeing &lt;dbl&gt;, .fitted &lt;dbl&gt;, .resid &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   .hat &lt;dbl&gt;, .sigma &lt;dbl&gt;, .cooksd &lt;dbl&gt;, .std.resid &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\nBinary/Ordinal Dependent Variable\n\nI used spending_binary as the response variable.
