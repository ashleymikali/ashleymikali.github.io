This project involved building multiple logistic regression models to predict whether individuals were likely to have ‘desirable’ or ‘undesirable’ spending habits. The final model was selected based on AIC and relevance to real-world applications.\nLearn more about the project here and see its execution here.",

    "text": "Model Selection\n\nBest Model Based on AIC: Model 3\nBest Model Based on BIC: Model 2\nBest Model Based on Significance: Model 2 (all p-values were statistically significant).\n\nAfter careful consideration, Model 3 was selected as the primary model. This decision was based on its stronger analytical credibility (as indicated by the AIC) and its alignment with the research question, as it accounts for both predictor variables. While Model 2 also performed well, it only considered one of the predictors, making it less representative of the full scope of the research.",

    "text": "About Me\nHi, I’m Ash. I’m a junior double majoring in Philosophy and Mathematics-Computer Science with a specialization in Data Science. I’m especially interested in the philosophy of mind and the ways data science and philosophy intersect—particularly when it comes to understanding human behavior and decision-making. Data science lets me explore real-world problems, while my background in philosophy helps me think critically about the implications of what I find.\nWhen I’m not working on school stuff, you can find me playing indie games like Stardew Valley or Moonstone Island. I’m a fan of all sorts of music, from jazz to hyperpop to rock. I also love cozy things—hot chocolate, blankets, and fall are some of my favorite comforts. If I’m not gaming or listening to music, I’ll probably be baking cupcakes (they’re easier to share) for my friends or catching up on Severance (no spoilers, please).\n\nYou can find my GitHub here.",
